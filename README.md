# Red-Bubble-Uploader-GUI

This GUI app enables you to easily upload designs to red bubble with no limit. I personally use this interface to upload
designs to my red bubble acount. It aims to aid those who are in the print on demand entreprenur route. You can save time and energy
with the use of this. I've added an instruction manual to further clarify the uses of the components aligned for this project.

I used python being it as my first programming language with the help of selenium. For sure, it wasn't a walk in the park putting
this up all together but I can be happy with this one.
